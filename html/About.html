            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p class="text">
                I took a beginners course to photography in 2019
                Later in 2021 I took his advanced course, and also traveled with him to Georgia.
                in Kfar Yehoshua with a teacher named Gilad Ben Shatz.

                In 2022 I took a landscape photography course by the photographer Tomer Razabi.
                Later that year I traveled to Japan by myself, and Iceland with Tomer's company - Wild Travel.

                I have many more things to learn and experience with photography.
                I want to keep documenting my life and my special moments with my camera.
                I chose this subject because photography is not only a hobby to me,
                it's a way to make moments in life special by documenting an expressing myself.
